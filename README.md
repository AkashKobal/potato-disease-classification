# Potato Disease Classification with Deep Learning

This repository implements a deep learning-based solution for accurate classification of potato diseases. Leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of potato plant images, encompassing various diseases.<br>

<h5>Key Features:</h5><br>
1. Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a robust CNN architecture for high-precision disease classification.<br>
2. Dataset: A curated dataset of diverse potato plant images, annotated with disease labels.<br>
3. Training Pipeline: Clear and reproducible code for model training, including data preprocessing and augmentation.<br>
4. Evaluation Metrics: Detailed analysis of model performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.<br>
5. Inference: Deploy the trained model for real-time or batch inference on new potato plant images.<br>

<h5>Getting Started:</h5><br>
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AkashKobal/potato-disease-classification`<br>
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for model training and evaluation.<br>
